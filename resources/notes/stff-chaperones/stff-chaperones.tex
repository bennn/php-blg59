\summary{Chaperones and Impersonators: Run-time Support for Reasonable Interposition}

A \emph{chaperone} is a proxy limited to stateful behavior.
For instance a chaperone can record a log of all accesses to a vector, but it may not change the value returned by an access.

An \emph{impersonator} is an unrestricted proxy limited to mutable data structures.
Impersonators can do anything with their inputs and give any output.

These are really great, and they have low overhead~\cite{stff-chaperones}.
Possibly because the core implementation is in the C runtime system.
