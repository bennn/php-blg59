\summary{Dynamic Inference of Static Types for Ruby}

Collect type constraints by monitoring program paths in a training run.
Static types inferred from the dynamic constraints.

For soundness, only need to cover each expression once.
Does not need to cover each expression with each possible assignment of variables
 (because the language is purely functional or they assume the type of state used in a loop is invariant\textemdash which is pretty reasonable).

P.S. in the related work, soft types is ``written off'' for not handling objects.
