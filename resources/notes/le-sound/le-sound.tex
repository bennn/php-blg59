\summary{Sound Type-Dependent Syntactic Language Extension}

Presents a framework for defining typed languages and extending them with syntactic sugar~\cite{le-sound}.
The sugarings can extend the valid expressions and types of the language.

All syntax extensions are guaranteed type-sound, and are typechecked before they elaborate into core syntax.
Thus any type errors are caught early and presented to the user in terms of the surface syntax.

\swtable{
\item
  Promotes (some form of) extensible type systems.
\item
  Preserves extensions' abstraction barriers, probably makes errors easy to debug.
}{
\item
  Language extensions must be expressible in the core; growth is limited by the language you begin with.
\item
  The system is no help to existing languages.
  Before a language can grow, it must be defined within the authors' framework.
}

Hmph, this makes me think macrotypes would've had a good shot at POPL.
