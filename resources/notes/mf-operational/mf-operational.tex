\summary{Operational Semantics for Multi-Language Programs}

This paper gives semantics for language interoperability~\cite{mf-operational}.\footnote{The title is a complete description.}
The presentation is divided into three sections: initially foreign values are considered opaque, next they are given meaning in a type system, and finally they are monitored by higher-order contracts.
The benefits and drawbacks of each approach are clearly stated.


\swtable{
\item
  Identifies the problem of defining \emph{type-preserving} semantics between higher-order languages.
\item
  Bold use of color.
\item
  Good motivation, includes many references to industry projects for language interop.
}{
\item
  The ML and Scheme languages are very similar.
  How would this scale if ML added references or Scheme had \texttt{call/cc}?
\item
  Similarly, how about transitive interop?
  Or even fixpoints?
  But it makes sense to leave a full exploration of those design spaces to future work.
