<H1>Dissertation Advice by Olin Shivers</H1>
I give the same advice to graduate students writing dissertations
so often that I will set it down here to save myself the repetition.

<H2>What is your thesis?</H2>
First, do you understand the difference between a dissertation and a thesis?
A <EM>thesis</EM> is an <EM>idea</EM>.
A <EM>dissertation</EM> is a <EM>document</EM> that supports your thesis.
After you write your dissertation explaining why your thesis is a good
one, you have to stand up in front of a crowd and defend it -- the thesis
defence.

<P>
It is best if you can capture your thesis in a single sentence. 
If you can do this, make it sentence #1 of your dissertation, and
repeat this sentence, word for word, wherever you need to drive
home the point of your dissertation.
This is a tremendous aid in focussing your work.
A side benefit is that it provides an unassailable defense to an
entire class of attacks on your work.
For example, should someone attack your work by pointing out that
it does not scale, you simply reply, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    You may be correct, but right or wrong, your point is irrelevant.
    My thesis is that "crossbreeding gerbils with hamsters provides an
    <EM>order of magnitude</EM> speedup over standard treadmill technology."
    I clearly demonstrate factors of 12-17 in my dissertation; I make no
    claims beyond an order of magnitude.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is one of the benefits of focus.

<H3>Some examples</H3>

When I wrote <a href="https://www.ccis.neu.edu/home/shivers/papers/diss.pdf">my dissertation</a>, I began with the opening sentence:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Control-flow analysis is feasible and useful for higher-order languages.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Then I spent 200 pages explaining first how to do CFA for higher-order
languages (feasible), and second, the kinds of optimisations it enables
(useful). 
My dissertation was nominated for the 1991 ACM Distinguished Dissertation
award.

<P>
The first chapter of John Ellis' dissertation, 
<a href="https://cs.utah.edu/~blg/resources/pdf/john-ellis-1985.pdf"><EM>Bulldog: A Compiler for VLIW Architectures,</EM></a>
is titled "My Thesis."
Not much room for misinterpretation here -- it's clear what the
chapter is all about.
The first sentence of this chapter is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ordinary scientific programs can be compiled for a new parallel architecture
called VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word),
yielding order of magnitude speedups over scalar architectures.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
There is never any doubt in the reader's mind what Ellis is setting
out to demonstrate with his book.

<P>
Ellis' dissertation received the 1985 ACM Distinguished Dissertation award.
I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see how to write academic
prose: it is the single best piece of academic writing I have
ever read.
It is clear and lucid.
It does not get tangled up in stilted, passive, jargon-laden "academic" style.
Ideas flow effortlessly off the page and into your head. 
When something is an opinion, it's obvious that it's an opinion;
when something is a fact, it's obvious that it's a fact.
You should try to write a dissertation this good.

<P>
The first sentence of Henry Massalin's dissertation
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/tibbetts/Public/tmp/cucs-039-92.pdf"><EM>Synthesis: An Efficient Implementation of Fundamental Operating System Services</EM></a>
is,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This dissertation shows that operating systems can provide fundamental
services an order of magnitude more efficiently than traditional 
implementations.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
He then spends 140 pages showing how this can be done.
Henry's dissertation was nominated for the 1992 ACM Distinguished Dissertation
award.

<P>
The point is: what are you trying to show?
The point is: what is your point?
If you can get that straight in your head, and put it up front
at the beginning of your document, you will be able to proceed in a straight
line.
You will know what things are essential, and what things are distractions
or detours.
You will know when to stop writing: when you have demonstrated your thesis.
If your thesis committee makes unreasonable demands of you, you will be
able to tell them: 
"(a) My thesis, as stated, is a solid advancement of the field, and
(b) I have supported my thesis.
This is all I need to do to graduate; 
your requests are above and beyond this threshold.
Cancel them and give me my degree."


<P>
Don't be alarmed if you are unable to precisely state your thesis
when you start work in your thesis area -- you may only have a general
and long-winded notion of the problem and its solution.
But you may find it useful, as you progress in your work, to refine this
down to that single sentence (or couple of sentences) that states your
thesis.
As you grind away on your PhD, and your understanding of your problem matures,
it will help you to have a little background voice asking at regular intervals:
"What is my thesis?"

<H2>Recommended reading</H2>
I recommend Mary-Claire van Leunen's <a href="https://archive.org/details/handbookforschol00mary"><EM>A Handbook for Scholars</EM></a>
to any academic author who wishes to write well.
Mary-Claire's book will help you write clear, unpretentious, unstilted
academic prose.
She also gives excellent advice on the details of citations and
bibliography.
