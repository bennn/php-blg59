In my role as the director of a Ph.D. program, I often quote David Touretzky,
an old college friend, who once explained that you start graduate school with a
vision of:

 “my dissertation: the movie”

and you end graduate school with:

 “my dissertation: the pretty good short story.”

I tell our students that the trick is to accept the inevitable and to shoot for
a very good short story.
