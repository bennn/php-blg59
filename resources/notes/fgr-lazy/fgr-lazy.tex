\summary{Lazy Contract Checking for Immutable Data Structures}

The paper notes 2 desirable alternatives for data structure contracts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Structures following an invariant should be subtypes of structures possibly-not following the invariant.
\item Contracts should not change the asymptotic complexity of an algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

The point of $1$ is data structures should not always be black-box.
If a library designer exposes his type representation, users should be able to synthesize data structures without using the library's constructors.
Also, it should be possible to re-use third-party functions on compatible data, even if the third-party does not necessarily preserve the data structure's invariants.

Supporting $1$ previously violated $2$, as every call to a library function would exhaustively check a data structure.
This paper solves the issue with lazy recursive contracts~\cite{fgr-lazy} 

The new operator is {\tt define-contract-struct}\footnote{As of Jan. 2016, Racket integrates dependent struct contracts with the conventional {\tt struct} keyword.}
Recursive structs are validated as they are explored\textemdash only when a field is accessed.

\emph{Caveat:} this works only for structs; the built-in {\tt vector} and {\tt hash} types, etc, are still eager.
