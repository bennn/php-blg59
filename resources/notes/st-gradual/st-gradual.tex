\summary{Gradual Typing for Functional Languages}

This paper introduces the catchphrase ``gradual typing'' and describes a cast-based type system that admits untyped terms~\cite{st-gradual}.
Type safety in this system means that if a term may be assigned a type (with ``dynamic'' holes), then it will evaluate to either a value or a run-time cast error.
To handle diverging terms, the authors parameterize evaluation by a natural number limiting the number of computation steps.

\qquad The paper is written ``by th' book''~\cite{p-tapl} and reads nicely.
Moreover, all proofs are formalized in Isabelle.


\swtable{
\item Excellent title.
\item Clear presentation.
\item Casts are a neat solution to mutable references and untyped functions.
  (Rather than striving to preserve an invariant, delay the check until necessary.)
}{
\item
  The benefits of the untyped language are not well motivated (besides terms like ``flexible'' etc).
  In particular, I would like to know when gradual typing might be more useful than type inference.
\item
  Eliding blame is a mistake.
  A $\mathsf{CastError}$ is no better than a segfault if it does not accurately tell where the problem occurred.
