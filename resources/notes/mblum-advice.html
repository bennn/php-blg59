        Books are not scrolls.<br>
        Scrolls must be read like the Torah from one end to the other. <br>
        Books are random access -- a great innovation over scrolls. <br>
        Make use of this innovation! Do NOT feel obliged to read a book fro=
m beginning=20
        to end.<br>
        Permit yourself to open a book and start reading from anywhere.<br>
        In the case of mathematics or physics or anything especially hard, =
try=20
        to find something anything that you can understand.<br>
        Read what you can. <br>
        Write in the margins. (You know how useful that can be.)<br>
        Next time you come back to that book, you'll be able to read more.<=
br>
        You can gradually learn extraordinarily hard things this way.</p>
      <p>Consider writing what you read as you read it. <br>
        This is especially true if you're intent on reading something hard.=
</p>
      <p>I remember a professor of Mathematics at MIT, <br>
        name of BERTRAM KOSTANT, <br>
        who would keep his door open whenever he was in his office, and he =
would=20
        always be at his desk writing. <br>
        Writing. Always writing. <br>
        Was he writing up his research? Maybe. <br>
        Writing up his ideas? Maybe. <br>
        I personally think he was reading, and writing what he was reading.=
 <br>
        At least for me, writing what I read is one of the most enjoyable a=
nd=20
        profitable ways to learn hard material.</p>
      <p><br>
        <span class=3D"authors">STUDYING:</span><a name=3D"STUDYING"></a><b=
r>
        You are all computer scientists.<br>
        You know what FINITE AUTOMATA can do.<br>
        You know what TURING MACHINES can do.<br>
        For example, Finite Automata can add but not multiply.<br>
        Turing Machines can compute any computable function.<br>
        Turing machines are incredibly more powerful than Finite Automata.<=
br>
        Yet the only difference between a FA and a TM is that <br>
        the TM, unlike the FA, has paper and pencil.<br>
        Think about it. <br>
        It tells you something about the power of writing.<br>
        Without writing, you are reduced to a finite automaton.<br>
        With writing you have the extraordinary power of a Turing machine.<=

        CLAUDE SHANNON once told me that as a kid, he remembered being stuc=
k on=20
        a jigsaw puzzle. <br>
        His brother, who was passing by, said to him:<br>
        "You know: I could tell you something." <br>
        That's all his brother said. <br>
        Yet that was enough hint to help Claude solve the puzzle.<br>
        The great thing about this hint... is that you can always give it t=
o yourself=20
        !!!<br>
        I advise you, when you're stuck on a hard problem, <br>
        to imagine a little birdie or an older version of yourself whisperi=

        <br>
        "... I could tell you something..."</p>
      <p>I once asked UMESH VAZIRANI how he was able,<br>
        as an undergraduate at MIT, <br>
        to take 6 courses each and every semester. <br>
        He said that he knew he didn't have the time to work out his answer=
s the=20
        hard way. <br>
        He had to find a shortcut.<br>
        You see, Umesh understood that problems often have short clever sol=

      <p><br>
        There will come a time when you work on a problem long and hard but=

        See this as the GREAT opportunity it is to learn something importan=

        <br>
        Don't let it pass you by.<br>
        Ask yourself: "How SHOULD I have been thinking to solve that proble=

        <br>
        I have found that doing so is a powerful exercise. <br>
        Danny Sleator tells me that BOB FLOYD independently recommended exa=
ctly=20
        this exercise to his students. <br>
        He would lead them into asking themselves: <br>
        "How COULD I have led myself to that answer?" <br>
        Take the time to think it through. <br>
        It's worth it. </p>
      <p>There will come a time when you work on a problem long and hard an=

        :) <br>
        And then you learn that someone else already published. :( <br>
        Hard as that may be for you to take, you must view this too as a gr=

        opportunity. <br>
        Don't turn off. Read what got published. </p>
      <p>You will be surprised how often the published paper turns out to b=

        in some significant way. Roughly <br>
        50% of the time, it is NOT at all the same as what you did. <br>
        25% of the time, it is the same but not as good.<br>
        25% of the time it is better. </p>
      <p>This means that 50% of the time or more, you can still publish.</p=

      <p>And what about the 25% time that what got published is better than=
 your=20
        own? <br>
        In that case, you have a great opportunity to learn.<br>
        Ask yourself: "How SHOULD I have been thinking to solve the problem=
=20
        in this fine way?" </p>
      <p>This is how I discovered, as a young engineer, that I should learn=
 something=20
        enormously powerful called "Modern Algebra." <br>
        It's one reason I switched from Electrical Engineering as an underg=
raduate=20
        major to Mathematics as a Graduate major.<br>
        Of course, this was before there existed anything called Computer S=
cience.</p>
      <p><br>
        Still on THINKING... <br>
        The importance of PARADOX and CONTRADICTION.<br>
        When you can prove that a statement S is true, <br>
        and you can prove that the same statement S is false, <br>
        then you KNOW that that you're on to something:<br>
        Something is wrong somewhere. <br>
        Never underestimate the power of a contradiction. <br>
        It is one of our most potent sources of knowledge.</p>
      <p>Examples include the Liar Paradox "This statement is false."=20
        with its applications to Set Theory and our understanding of langua=
ge.<br>
        There are the seeming paradoxes of countability and uncountability,=
 <br>
        In CS, there is the apparent paradox that leads to The Halting Prob=
lem.<br>
        Physics has lots of paradoxical material:<br>
        Quantum Theory. The Einstein-Rosen-Podulsky Paradox. <br>
        The relativistically speeding Twins. <br>
        The wave and particle nature of matter.</p>
      <p> Here's an ASIDE on my current work, also based on paradox:<br>
        I am personally interested in the Paradox of consciousness. Compare=
 the=20
        following two views:<br>
        1. the view that the human is a MECHANISM, an automaton<br>
        with substantial but finite internal memory, programmed like <br>
        any computer to do whatever it does, and/or<br>
        2. the view that the human is a thoughtful observant<br>
        creature with a God-like free will; that it is a CONSCIOUS<br>
        ENTITY at the controls of a highly complex highly capable<br>
        mechanism, choosing what to do from among options served up<br>
        by/from its vast unconscious below.</p>
      <p> In my view, both these views are correct. How can that be?</p>
      <p> In his "Life of Johnson," James Boswell quotes Samuel Johnson<br>
        as saying:<br>
        "All theory is against the freedom of the will; all experience<br>
        is for it." <br>
        Johnson was 18 years old when Newton (age 85) was buried.<br>
        Johnson knew that F=3DMA implied that humans are mechanisms.</p>
      <p> "All theory is against the freedom of the will; all experience<br=
>
        is for it." </p>
      <p> This ends my ASIDE.</p>
      <p>Make a list for yourself of good ways to pursue a problem.<br>
        My own favorite is to try small examples. By comparison,<br>
        DAVID GRIES's favorite is to put himself in the middle <br>
        of a (presumed) solution. An example is his coffee can problem:<br>
        Given a can of black and white coffee beans, do the following: Pull=
 out=20
        two beans: if both are the same color, replace them with a white be=
an.=20
        If the two are different, replace them with a black bean. What colo=
r is=20
        the last bean? </p>
      <p>Or try out the two methods on the Hershey Bar problem<br>
        [Give an optimal algorithm to break an mxn Hershey bar into<br>
        1x1 pieces. At each step, you can choose a single rectangle<br>
        of chocolate and crack it along one of its vertical or<br>
        horizontal lines. A single crack counts one step. You are to<br>
        make the fewest number of cracks] </p>
      <p>Brains are muscles.<br>
        They grow strong with exercise. <br>
        And even if they're strong, they grow weak without it.<br>
        In the months before Kasparov lost to Deep Blue, <br>
        his mother came after him. <br>
        She was worried that he wasn't spending enough time <br>
        exercising himself (on chess). <br>
        Her worries proved well-founded.</p>

        I remember a great summer job I once had at IVIC <br>
        (Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificos). <br>
        A top neurophysiologist, name of Svaetichin, gave me a splendid pro=
blem...=20
        one that I unfortunately could not solve. <br>
        The problem was to find a way to focus light on a single cell <br>
        of a goldfish retina so that the light would not spill over <br>
        onto any of the adjacent cells. <br>
        Svaetichin had tried making a pinhole in a sheet of black tin, <br>
        and shining his light thru the hole. This worked for moderate size =
holes,=20
        but failed for really small holes, which caused the light to diverg=
e,=20
        to form diffraction patterns. </p>
      <p>Since Svaetichin couldn't solve the problem, I decided I couldn't.=
 Or=20
        perhaps it's that I thought his problem physically unsolvable. In r=
etrospect,=20
        I should have taken out books on physics, especially optics, read a=
s much=20
        as I could, talked to others and kept on talking to him. <br>
        Svaetichin would have helped me if I had shown him I was reading th=
inking=20
        working.</p>
      <p>Don't expect your thesis advisor to give you a problem that he or =
she=20
        can answer. Of course, she might.<br>
        * She might give you a problem to which she already knows an answer=
.<br>
        * She might give you a problem that she thinks is answerable, <br>
        but that she hasn't actually answered.<br>
        * She might give you a problem that is deadly hard.<br>
        * If the problem she gives you is hard enough, <br>
        I suggest you look for a NONSTANDARD answer. <br>
        More on this later after I get done cooking the thesis advisor.</p>
      <p>Your thesis advisor may encourage you to work in an area <br>
        that she feels completely comfortable in... in which case you can r=
ely=20
        on her for sage advice and sound guidance.<br>
        Or she may encourage you to work on something she knows little or n=
othing=20
        about, in which case it will be up to you to inform and teach her.<=
br>
        In the latter case, you will have to learn all you can for yourself=
...=20
        <br>
        You will have to learn from other faculty, from courses, from books=
, from=20
        journals. from peers.<br>
        Both kinds of advisors can work out for you. <br>
        I don't know that one is necessarily better than the other. <br>
        But you should know which you got.</p>
      <p>Whatever you do, you got to like doing it.... <br>

        There's a wonderful quote from ANATOLE FRANCE:<br>
        "A University Student" <br>
        -- and this is especially true for a PhD Student --<br>
        "should know something about everything <br>
        and everything about something."</p>
      <p>You know the jokes about PhD's... <br>
        A PhD knows more and more about less and less <br>
        until he knows everything about nothing.</p>
      <p>When working on a PhD, you must focus on a topic so narrow that yo=
u can=20
        understand it completely.<br>
        It will seem at first that you're working on the proverbial needle,=
 a=20
        tiny fragment of the world, a minute crystal, <br>
        beautiful but in the scheme of things, microscopic.<br>
        Work with it. And the more you work with it, the more you penetrate=

        the more you will come to see that your work, your subject, encompa=

        WILLIAM BLAKE (1757-1827)</p>
      <p>This gorgeous quartet is followed by a large number of sometimes d=
eep=20
        sometimes questionable aphorisms, which I see much like the occasio=
nally=20
        grinding work of a PhD thesis.</p>
      <p><br>
        There's all kinds of research you can do.<br>
        There's research to prove what you know to be true.<br>
        There's research -- maybe better called SEARCH -- to figure out wha=
t is=20
        true.<br>
        Some of the best such search succeeds in DISPROVING <br>
        what you initially believed to most certainly be true.</p>
      <p>For example, Sir Fred Hoyle is said to have coined the phrase "Big=
=20
        Bang" at a time when he was looking to disprove it.</p>
      <p>For a relatively minor but personal example: <br>
        When I was working on the MEDIAN problem, <br>
        my goal was to prove that any deterministic algorithm to find the M=
EDIAN=20
        of n integers must necessarily make roughly as many comparisons as =
it=20
        takes to sort n integers, i.e. n log n comparisons. <br>
        I was shocked to discover that the median of n integers can be foun=
d with=20
        just O(n) comparisons.</p>
      <p>When working on proving some statement S true, <br>
        you should spend at least some time trying to prove it false.<br>
        Even if it's true, trying to prove it false can give insight.<br>
        And in any case, too often, our intuition is dead wrong.</p>
      <p>There is yet another sense in which, when working on a hard proble=
m,=20
        you may find that the answer is NOT what you expected. <br>
        You may be looking for a YES or a NO; it may be something else.</p>
      <p>Some years ago, JOHN HOPCROFT gave one of his PhD students the pro=
blem=20
        of deciding the Equivalence of Free Boolean Forms. <br>
        The specifics don't matter. <br>
        The problem appeared as an open problem in Garey and Johnson. <br>
        The question was: Is the Equivalence problem NP-complete? <br>
        Or is it solvable in poly time? <br>
        Chandra, Wegman and I found a randomizing algorithm for this proble=
lm.=20
        At the time this seemed to beg the question entirely. Only after wr=
iting=20
        it up did we really understand that we had given an efficient albei=
t randomizing=20
        algorithm to solve it, This shows, by the way, that the problem is =
not=20
        NP-complete if NP &lt;&gt; RP (Randomizing Poly-time), as seems lik=
ely.=20
      </p>
      <p>Of course, this brings up the question whether P =3D NP. <br>
        The question of our time: Are NP-complete problems solvable in poly=
 time?=20
        <br>
        Could anything I have said today be useful for so hard a problem as=
 that?=20
        <br>
        Probably not. Nevertheless...<br>
        LEONID LEVIN believes as I do that whatever the answer to the P=3DN=
P? problem,=20
        it won't be like anything you think it should be. And he has given =
some=20
        wonderful examples. <br>
        For one, he has given a FACTORING ALGORITHM that is proVably optima=
l,=20
        up to a multiplicative constant. <br>
        He proves that if his algorithm is exponential, <br>
        then every algorithm for FACTORING is exponential. <br>
        Equivalently, if any algorithm for factoring is poly-time, <br>
        then his algorithm is poly-time. <br>
        But we haven't been able to tell the running time of his algorithm =
because,=20
        in a strong sense, it's running time is unanalyzable. <br>
        Maybe as STEVEN RUDICH suggests, the P=3DNP? problem is undecidable=
 in the=20
        standard formalization of Mathematics.</p>
      <p>The point is that the answer may not lie where you expect it. Here=

        kicking and screaming in the right direction. <br>
        It's a comparison to the blind spot in our eyes, <br>
        which isn't really blind but makes things up for us. <br>
        It questions whether there might not be other things in this world =

      <p> "First have something to say, <br>

a><br>
        Don't expect your thesis advisor to read your thesis. Some thesis a=
dvisors=20
        can and do give good feedback, but not all.<br>
        Still, make sure that SOMEBODY reads your thesis... <br>
        I especially recommend that you ask your peers.</p>
      <p>Here's another piece of advice that I have often had to give mysel=
f,=20
        and I here give you...<br>
        When you send a paper off to be published,<br>
        and it gets rejected...<br>
        Don't be turned off by the mindless cretinous feedback <br>
        that you get to your well-thought-out beautifully-written work!<br>
        Be a MENSCH. Use the feedback to improve your paper! <br>
        Make it better. And send it back.</p>
      <p><br>
        Finally, it is my most earnest wish that you should know something =

        there is stuff more basic still that underlies and <br>
        DRIVES<br>
        not only man <br>
        but all great beasts,</p>
      <p>And that is nature's call to each of us... to be special.<br>
        To be distinguished in some way. To be<br>
        UNIQUE.<br>
        To BE something, to DO something, BETTER than everyone else.</p>
      <p> Like the leather nosed chimpanzee,<br>
        dragging noisy cans and branches,<br>
        frightening peers into submission,</p>
      <p>One does not have to be brilliant, a genius, to be special.<br>
        To do something better than anyone/everyone else. To be<br>
        UNMATCHED,<br>
        One has only to choose an END <br>
        any END <br>
        that MATTERS <br>
        that INSPIRES <br>
        YOU <br>
        And then DO IT. </p>
