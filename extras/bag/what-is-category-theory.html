        At 9 minutes 30 seconds he characterizes the entire field of category theory.
        TODO add quote.

        That's really it.
        Category theory gets at the skeleton of the thing you're working with.
        It's not pretty, normally, but it is the backbone, the fundamental structure, of whatever you're working with.

        One criticism of category theory is that the proofs don't give insight.
        You're right, they don't.
        They're too abstract for that, tough luck!

        But they are all about the fundamentals.
