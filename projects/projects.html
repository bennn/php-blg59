        <p class="pubauthors">
          Implements an extensible family of languages for checking correctness properties of poems.
          For instance, we have a little checker for <a class="colorlink" href="https://github.com/bennn/iPoe/blob/master/ipoe/haiku/lang/reader.rkt">haikus</a> and another for <a class="colorlink" href="https://github.com/bennn/iPoe/blob/master/ipoe/english-sonnet/lang/reader.rkt">sonnets</a>.
          These are defined through a uniform specification language, which compiles its programs into specific poetry-checking programs.

          The "interactive" part is very important.
          Unless told otherwise, the checker will actively search for new words and keep a dialog with the user.
          Next up is learning some rules of English based on these interactions.

        <h3 class="pubtitle"><a class="publink" href="https://github.com/tateology/java-corpus/">Java Corpus</a></h3>
        <p class="pubauthors">
          A collection of open-source Java projects, gathered while I was working on the <a class="colorlink" href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ross/publications/shapes/index.html">shapes paper</a>.
          Each project is in a separate folder, and each folder contains a small <tt>compile.sh</tt> script.
          These scripts are direct calls to <tt>javac</tt>, so it's very easy to swap in your own compiler.

        <p class="pubauthors">
          A small REPL interface to Racket bytecode (.zo) files.
          Has a string-based search features, and can be called from the command-line to give a count of AST nodes' frequency.

        <p class="pubauthors">
          Courseware for <a class="hiddenlink" href="../teaching/teaching.html">CS 3110</a> at Cornell.
          Streamlines compilation and unit testing for students (no need to call ocamlc!), and helps staff with grading; in particular running and collecting statistics on a test suite and emailing students if their submission failed to compile.
