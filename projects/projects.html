        <p class="pubauthors">
          A collection of open-source Java projects, gathered while I was working on the <a class="colorlink" href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ross/publications/shapes/index.html">shapes paper</a>.
          Each project is in a separate folder, and each folder contains a small <tt>compile.sh</tt> script.
          These scripts are direct calls to <tt>javac</tt>, so it's very easy to swap in your own compiler.

        <p class="pubauthors">
          While on staff for <a class="hiddenlink" href="../teaching/teaching.html">CS 3110</a> at Cornell, I helped develop a command line utility for students and staff.
          It streamlines compilation and unit testing for students, and helps staff with many aspects of grading; in particular running and collecting statistics on a test suite and emailing students if their submission failed to compile.
